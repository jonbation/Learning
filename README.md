# 🌱 Learning — My Journey in Mobile & Software Development

Welcome to my **Learning Repository** — a living archive of my journey as a developer exploring the foundations of mobile application development and programming concepts.  

Each folder here represents a milestone — from my first Android apps in Kotlin to experiments that shaped how I think about architecture, user experience, and scalable systems.

## 🚀 My Learning Focus

Over time, this repo evolved from “just practice” to a foundation for:
- Writing **clean, modular Kotlin code**
- Understanding **Android app lifecycle and UI patterns**
- Exploring **APIs, local storage, and asynchronous operations**
- Building the mindset of a **problem solver**, not just a coder

## 🧩 Future Direction

I’m currently expanding into:
- **Full-stack development** using Laravel, Node.js, and React Native  
- **Cloud-native systems** (Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines)  
- Building products that make a real-world impact — from fintech to agritech  

This repo reminds me that every expert was once a beginner, and progress is built line by line.
