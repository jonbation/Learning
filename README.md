### List of Applications

#### Part-A

- [Visiting Card](https://github.com/iamishandubey/18CSMP68/tree/main/VisitingCard)
  >Create an application to design aVisiting Card. The Visiting card should havea companylogoatthe
  >top right corner. The company name should be displayed in Capital letters, aligned to the center.
  >Information like the name of the employee, job title, phone number, address, email, fax and the
  >website address isto be displayed. Insert a horizontal line between the job title and the phone
  >number. 
  
- [Calculator](https://github.com/iamishandubey/18CSMP68/tree/main/Calculator)
  >Develop an Android application usingcontrols like Button, TextView, EditText for designing a
  >calculatorhaving basic functionality like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication,andDivision. 
  
- [Wallpaper](https://github.com/iamishandubey/18CSMP68/tree/main/Wallpaper)
  >Develop an application to set an image as wallpaper. On click of a button, the wallpaper image
  >should start to change randomly every 30 seconds.
  
- [Counter](https://github.com/iamishandubey/18CSMP68/tree/main/Counter)
  >Write a program to create an activity with two buttons START and STOP. On
  >pressingoftheSTART button, the activity must start the counter by displaying the numbers from
  >One and the counter must keep on counting until the STOP button is pressed. Display the counter
  >value in a TextViewcontrol. 
  
- [Parsing XML and JSON](https://github.com/iamishandubey/18CSMP68/tree/main/ParsingXMLandJSON)
  >Create two files of XML and JSON type with values for City_Name, Latitude, Longitude,
  >Temperature,andHumidity. Develop an application to create an activity with two buttons to parse
  >the XML and JSON files which when clicked should display the data in their respective layouts
  >side by side. 
  
- [Text To Speech](https://github.com/iamishandubey/18CSMP68/tree/main/TextToSpeech)
  >Develop a simple application withoneEditTextso that the user can write some text in it. Create a
  >button called “Convert Text to Speech” that converts the user input text into voice.
  
- [Phone Dialer](https://github.com/iamishandubey/18CSMP68/tree/main/PhoneDialer)
  >Create an activity like a phone dialer withCALLand SAVE buttons. On pressing the CALL
  >button, it must call the phone number and on pressing the SAVE button it must save the number
  >to the phone contacts. 
  
#### Part-B

- [File Application](https://github.com/iamishandubey/18CSMP68/tree/main/FileApplication)
  >Write a program to create an activity having a Text box, and also Save, Open and Create buttons.
  >The user has to write some text in the Text box. On pressing the Create button the text should be
  >saved as a text file in MkSDcard. On subsequent changes to the text, the Save button should be
  >pressed to store the latest content to the same file. On pressing the Open button, it should display
  >the contents from the previously stored files in the Text box. If the user tries to save the contents
  >in the Textbox to a file without creating it, then a toast message has to be displayed saying “First
  >Create a File”.

- [Media Player](https://github.com/iamishandubey/18CSMP68/tree/main/MediaPlayer)
  >Create an application to demonstrate a basic media playerthat allows the user to Forward,
  >Backward, Play and Pause an audio. Also, make use of the indicator in the seek bar to move the
  >audio forward or backward as required. 
  
- [Asynchronous Task](https://github.com/iamishandubey/18CSMP68/tree/main/AsynchronousTask)
  >Develop an application to demonstrate the use of Asynchronous tasks in android. The
  >asynchronous task should implement the functionality of a simple moving banner. On pressing the
  >Start Task button, the banner message should scrollfrom right to left. On pressing the Stop Task
  >button, the banner message should stop.Let the banner message be “Demonstration of
  >Asynchronous Task”.
  
- [Clipboard](https://github.com/iamishandubey/18CSMP68/tree/main/Clipboard)
  >Develop an application that makes use of the clipboard framework for copying and pasting of the
  >text. The activity consists of two EditText controls and two Buttons to trigger the copy and paste
  >functionality.
  
- [Car EMI Calculator](https://github.com/iamishandubey/18CSMP68/tree/main/CarEMICalculator)
  >Create an AIDL service that calculates Car Loan EMI. The formula to calculate EMI is
  >E = P * (r(1+r)n)/((1+r)n-1)
  >where
  > E = The EMI payable on the car loan amount
  > P = The Car loan Principal Amount
  > r = The interest rate value computed on a monthly basis
  > n = The loan tenure in the form of months
  >The down payment amount has to be deducted from the principal amount paid towards buying the
  >Car. Develop an application that makes use of this AIDL service to calculate the EMI. This
  >application should have four EditText to read the PrincipalAmount, Down Payment, Interest Rate,
  >Loan Term (in months) and a button named as “Calculate Monthly EMI”. On click of this button,
  >the result should be shown in a TextView. Also, calculate the EMI by varying the Loan Term and
  >Interest Rate values.
