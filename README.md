  >Create two files of XML and JSON type with values for City_Name, Latitude, Longitude,
  >Temperature,andHumidity. Develop an application to create an activity with two buttons to parse
  >the XML and JSON files which when clicked should display the data in their respective layouts
  >side by side.

  >Backward, Play and Pause an audio. Also, make use of the indicator in the seek bar to move the
  >audio forward or backward as required. 
  
- [Clipboard](https://github.com/iamishandubey/18CSMP68/tree/main/Clipboard)

  >functionality.
  
- [Car EMI Calculator](https://github.com/iamishandubey/18CSMP68/tree/main/CarEMICalculator)
  >Create an AIDL service that calculates Car Loan EMI. The formula to calculate EMI is
  >E = P * (r(1+r)n)/((1+r)n-1)
  >where
  > E = The EMI payable on the car loan amount
  > P = The Car loan Principal Amount
  > r = The interest rate value computed on a monthly basis
  > n = The loan tenure in the form of months
  >The down payment amount has to be deducted from the principal amount paid towards buying the
  >Car. Develop an application that makes use of this AIDL service to calculate the EMI. This
  >application should have four EditText to read the PrincipalAmount, Down Payment, Interest Rate,
  >Loan Term (in months) and a button named as “Calculate Monthly EMI”. On click of this button,
  >the result should be shown in a TextView. Also, calculate the EMI by varying the Loan Term and
